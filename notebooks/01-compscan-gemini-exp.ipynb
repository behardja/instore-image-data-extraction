    "### Extraction Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Product Identification:** Identify all distinct products on the shelf. A product is typically defined by its unique packaging and corresponding electronic shelf label (ESL).\n",
    "2.  **Extractable Fields:** For each product, focus on the following properties: `UPC`, `Brand`, `Description`, `Price`, `Size`, and `UnitOfMeasure`.\n",
    "3.  **Field-Specific Instructions:**\n",
    "    *   **`UPC`**: Locate the UPC on the electronic shelf label (ESL) positioned directly beneath the product. If the UPC is not clearly visible or is in a non-standard format, try to find it using the google_search tool with the product's brand, description and size if appropriate. Do not guess the UPC; if you cannot find it with high confidence, leave the field blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "        **UPC Format Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        UPC codes have a standard format, most commonly the 12-digit UPC-A version used in North America. A UPC (Universal Product Code) is the number, while the barcode is the machine-readable visual representation of that number. Both are governed by the global standards organization GS1.\n",
    "\n",
    "        *   **The standard 12-digit format (UPC-A)**\n",
    "            The 12 digits of a UPC code are broken into three main components:\n",
    "            *   **Number system character (1 digit):** The first digit is a number system character that indicates how the code should be classified.\n",
    "                *   `0`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`: Standard UPC for most consumer products.\n",
    "                *   `2`: For variable-weight items like produce or meat.\n",
    "                *   `3`: For pharmaceuticals and health products.\n",
    "                *   `4`: For in-store use or special applications.\n",
    "                *   `5`: For coupons.\n",
    "            *   **Company prefix (6–10 digits):** The first six to ten digits are the company prefix, which is assigned by GS1 and uniquely identifies the product's brand owner.\n",
    "            *   **Item reference number (1–5 digits):** The item number is assigned by the brand owner to identify a specific product. The number of digits varies depending on the length of the company prefix. For example, a 16-gigabyte phone would have a different item number than a 32-gigabyte model.\n",
    "            *   **Check digit (1 digit):** The final digit is a check digit, calculated using a formula involving all the other numbers in the sequence. This digit helps ensure the integrity of the code during scanning.\n",
    "        *   **Other UPC formats**\n",
    "            While UPC-A is the most common format, other variants exist:\n",
    "            *   **UPC-E:** A shorter, 6-digit version used for smaller retail items, like cosmetics, that don't have enough space for the standard UPC-A barcode.\n",
    "    *   **`Price`**: Locate the price on the electronic shelf label (ESL) positioned directly beneath the product.\n",
    "    *   **`Description`**: Capture the main product title and any key variations or features mentioned on the packaging.\n",
    "    *   **`Size`**: Extract these from the packaging (e.g., '12 OZ' or '1.0 kg'). The `Size` should be the numerical value.\n",
    "    *   ** `UnitOfMeasure`:** should be the unit string (e.g., 'lb','ct','oz','Gallon', or 'pint'). If multiple units are present, prefer the one most commonly used for that product type.\n",
    "4.  **Strictness:** Do not infer, guess, or make up any values. If you cannot clearly and confidently determine the value for a field, omit that field from the final JSON object.\n",
    "5.  **ProcessingStatus Field (MANDATORY):** This field is required in every product object.\n",
    "    *   **Success:** If you were able to confidently extract the `Brand` and `Price`, set the value to: `\"SUCCESS\"`.\n",
    "    *   **Error/Clarification:** If you encounter significant issues—such as an unreadable image, ambiguous text, or the inability to confidently extract the key information—set the value to an informative error message. Use one of the following recommended structures, or provide a custom message specifying the issue:\n",
    "        *   `\"ERROR: IMAGE UNCLEAR - Cannot read price.\"`\n",
    "        *   `\"ERROR: DATA AMBIGUOUS - Multiple products visible, unclear which is primary.\"`\n",
    "        *   `\"CLARIFICATION REQUIRED - Please provide a clearer photo or specify the exact product name.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**GOAL:** Produce a single, valid JSON array of objects that adheres to the schema and extraction rules based on the provided image.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **MUST** adhere strictly to the following JSON Schema for your output. Do not include any text, explanations, or dialogue outside of the JSON object.\n",
